fileobj = open(example.txt, wt)
    fileobj = file object returned by open()
    filename = String name or file
    mode = string indicating the file's type and what we want to perform

First letter of mode indicates operation:
    r = means read.
    w = means write. If the file does not exists, it will be created. If already exists it will be over-written.
    x = means write, but only if file does not exists.
    a = means append (write after the end) if file exists.

Second letter of mode is file's type:
    t (or nothing) = means text.
    b = means binary.

Close the file once write is complete.
fileobj.close()
